# History Timeline

This is a mini site I built in order to get a better perspective of time and recent human history. Events and historical figures are displayed on a page where each vertical pixel represents one year for the past 12,000 years.

Check it out on Vercel [here](https://history-timeline-six.vercel.app/). Read some more notes I have about the motivations for the project [here](https://www.andrewlaskey.com/Andrew-Laskey-8f215a2f56104b2dae16c6d7f534f041?p=76201799db4b460b9be159bf3cdb8a07&pm=s)
